# NodeMCU ESP8266 Sensors Station

ESP8266 NodeMCU-based multi-sensor monitoring station firmware.

This project runs on an **ESP8266 NodeMCU** and reads data from one or more connected environmental sensors (e.g., temperature/humidity, light, rain, analog/digital sensors). Sensor readings are processed on the microcontroller and can be displayed locally or transmitted over Wi-Fi for logging and visualization.
